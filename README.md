### Projects üêæ
- <b>Song Analytics & Playlist Generator</b> | [Web App](http://music-analytics-playlist-maker.herokuapp.com/) - Created dataset of Lyrics for 21K top billboard songs (out of total 28K). App shows various song properties: lyrics, audio properties, billboard rank over years; the app also create Spotify playlists based on the song.
- <b>XKCD Comic Fetcher</b> | [Web App](https://xkcd-fetcher.herokuapp.com/) | [Code](https://github.com/sidgupta234/xkcd-comic-fetcher) - Give a keyword, and get the xkcd comic in response for your PPT needs :D.
- <b>Indian English ASR </b> | [Code](https://github.com/sidgupta234/Indian_English_ASR) - An Indian English ASR system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) has been designed using Kaldi(Povey et al., 2011). Used available continuous English speech transcribed data obtained from non-native Indian English speakers in order to build an ASR system. This project was made as part of the IIIT Hyderabad Advanced Summer School on Natural Language Processing (IASNLP 2022).
- <b>Automated Essay Scoring </b> | [Web App](http://essay-rater.in/) | [Code](https://github.com/sidgupta234/kaggle_automated_essay_scoring) - Assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). Given an essay, we need to come up with a model that can rate the essay on the basis of: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions. I operationalized vocabulary and conventions with basic heuristics. (App may not be accessible, thanks to Heroku calling off their free deployment tier)
- <b>Revivify </b> | [Code](https://github.com/sidgupta234/Revivify) - Made an end-to-end audio-based information retrieval system. Users can ask the system for relevant information on a topic, a summary of a topic, or the meaning & synonym of a word.

### Programming Resources I made ‚Äçüíª
- <b> Basic Python Programming notes </b> | [Jupyter notebook notes](https://github.com/sidgupta234/CodingNinjas_DataScience_MachineLearning) - This repository contains my Jupyter notebook notes for the said course by CodingNinjas. Notes have been written in a way that they are sufficient on their own to learn the basics of Python.
- <b> Interviewbit solutions </b> | [Codes](https://github.com/sidgupta234/InterviewBit) - Popular Software Engineering interview questions posed on Interviewbit and their solutions.
- <b> Geeks for Geeks Data Structure programs </b> | [Codes](https://github.com/sidgupta234/GFG) - Basic starter codes as well as solutions to introductory data structure problems listed on Geeks4Geeks website (Binary Tree, BST, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, Recursion, Heaps).

### Conference Publications / Posters üì¢
- [Language and Interaction Network Conference, Univ. of Edinburgh](https://linkedi2022.github.io)<b> | When Brain Autocorrects </b> | [Poster](https://continuous-fascinator-15a.notion.site/When-Brain-Autocorrects-0a708259d7bf45f0837d00edc259842b) - Conducted Lexical Decision Test to probe if people consider incorrectly spelled words as correct under certain conditions.
